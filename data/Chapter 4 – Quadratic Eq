Q.1: Represent the following situations in the form of quadratic equations:(i) The area of a rectangular plot is 528 m2. The length of the plot (in metres) is one more than twice its breadth. We need to find the length and breadth of the plot.(ii) A train travels a distance of 480 km at a uniform speed. If the speed had been 8 km/h less, then it would have taken 3 hours more to cover the same distance.
Q.2: Find the roots of quadratic equations by factorisation:(i) √2 x2 + 7x + 5√2=0(ii) 100x2 – 20x + 1 = 0
Q.3: Find two consecutive positive integers, sum of whose squares is 365.
Q.4: Find the roots of the following quadratic equations, if they exist, by the method of completing the square:(i) 2x2 – 7x +3 = 0(ii) 2x2 + x – 4 = 0
Q.5: The diagonal of a rectangular field is 60 metres more than the shorter side. If the longer side is 30 metres more than the shorter side, find the sides of the field.
Q.6 : Solve the quadratic equation 2x2 – 7x + 3 = 0 by using quadratic formula.
Q.7: Sum of the areas of two squares is 468 m2. If the difference of their perimeters is 24 m, find the sides of the two squares.
Q.8: Find the values of k for each of the following quadratic equations, so that they have two equal roots.(i) 2x2 + kx + 3 = 0(ii) kx (x – 2) + 6 = 0
Q.9: Is it possible to design a rectangular park of perimeter 80 and area 400 sq.m.? If so find its length and breadth.
Q.10: Find the discriminant of the equation 3×2– 2x +1/3= 0 and hence find the nature of its roots. Find them, if they are real.
