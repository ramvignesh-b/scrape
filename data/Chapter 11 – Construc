Q.1: Draw a line segment of length 7 cm. Find a point P on it which divides it in the ratio 3:5.
Q.2: Construct a triangle with sides 5 cm, 6 cm and 7 cm and then another triangle whose sides are 7/5 of the corresponding sides of the first triangle.
Q.3: Draw a circle of radius 3 cm. Take two points P and Q on one of its extended diameter each at a distance of 7 cm from its centre. Draw tangents to the circle from these two points P and Q.
Q. 4: Draw a circle with the help of a bangle. Take a point outside the circle. Construct the pair of tangents from this point to the circle.
Q. 5: Draw two concentric circles of radii 3 cm and 5 cm. Taking a point on the outer circle construct the pair of tangents to the other. Measure the length of a tangent and verify it by actual calculation.
