Q.1: How many tangents can be drawn from the external point to a circle? Answer: Two tangents can be drawn from the external point to a circle.Q.2:Given: A triangle OAB which is an isosceles triangle and AB is tangent to the circle with center O. Find the measure of ∠OAB.Answer: The measure of ∠OAB in the given isosceles triangle OAB will be 45 degrees.Q.3: What should be the angle between the two tangents which is drawn at the end of two radii and are inclined at an angle of 45 degrees?Answer: The angle between them shall be: 135 degrees.Q.4: Given a right triangle PQR which is right-angled at q. QR = 12 cm, PQ = 5 cm. The radius of the circle which is inscribed in triangle PQR will be?Answer: The radius of the circle will be 2 cm.Q.5: Define Tangent and Secant?Answer: A tangent is a line which meets the circle only in one point.A secant is a line which meets the circle at two points while intersecting it. These two points are always distinct.Q.6: What is circle?Answer: If we collect all the points given on a plane and are at a constant distance, we will get a circle. The constant distance will be called a radius and the fixed point will be the centre of the circle.Long Answer Type QuestionsQ.1: From a point Q, the length of the tangent to a circle is 24 cm and the distance of Q from the centre is 25 cm. The radius of the circle is(A) 7 cm (B) 12 cm(C) 15 cm (D) 24.5 cm
Q. 2: Prove that the tangents drawn at the ends of a diameter of a circle are parallel.
Q. 3: A quadrilateral ABCD is drawn to circumscribe a circle as shown in the figure. Prove that AB + CD = AD + BC
Q. 4: Two concentric circles are of radii 5 cm and 3 cm. Find the length of the chord of the larger circle which touches the smaller circle.
Q. 5: Let s denote the semi-perimeter of a triangle ABC in which BC = a, CA = b, AB = c. If a circle touches the sides BC, CA, AB at D, E, F, respectively, prove that BD = s – b.
