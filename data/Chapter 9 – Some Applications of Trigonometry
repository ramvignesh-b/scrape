Q.1:  The shadow of a tower standing on level ground is found to be 40 m longer when the Sun’s altitude is 30° than when it is 60°. Find the height of the tower.
Q. 2: A tree breaks due to storm and the broken part bends so that the top of the tree touches the ground making an angle 30° with it. The distance between the foot of the tree to the point where the top touches the ground is 8 m. Find the height of the tree.
Q. 3: Two poles of equal heights are standing opposite each other on either side of the road, which is 80 m wide. From a point between them on the road, the angles of elevation of the top of the poles are 60° and 30°, respectively. Find the height of the poles and the distances of the point from the poles.
Q. 4: A pole 6 m high casts a shadow 2√ 3 m long on the ground, then the Sun’s elevation is(A) 60° (B) 45° (C) 30° (D) 90°
Q. 5: The angle of elevation of the top of a tower from two points distant s and t from its foot are complementary. Prove that the height of the tower is √st.
