Q.1: How many tangents can be drawn from the external point to a circle?

Q.2:Given: A triangle OAB which is an isosceles triangle and AB is tangent to the circle with center O. Find the measure of ∠OAB.
Answer: The measure of ∠OAB in the given isosceles triangle OAB will be 45 degrees.

Q.3: What should be the angle between the two tangents which is drawn at the end of two radii and are inclined at an angle of 45 degrees?

Q.4: Given a right triangle PQR which is right-angled at q. QR = 12 cm, PQ = 5 cm. The radius of the circle which is inscribed in triangle PQR will be?
Answer: The radius of the circle will be 2 cm.

Q.5: Define Tangent and Secant?
Answer: A tangent is a line which meets the circle only in one point.
A secant is a line which meets the circle at two points while intersecting it. These two points are always distinct.

Q.6: What is circle?
Answer: If we collect all the points given on a plane and are at a constant distance, we will get a circle. The constant distance will be called a radius and the fixed point will be the centre of the circle.

Q.1: From a point Q, the length of the tangent to a circle is 24 cm and the distance of Q from the centre is 25 cm. The radius of the circle is
(A) 7 cm (B) 12 cm
(C) 15 cm (D) 24.5 cm
Solution: 
First, draw a perpendicular from the centre O of the triangle to a point P on the circle which is touching the tangent. This line will be perpendicular to the tangent of the circle.

So, OP is perpendicular to PQ i.e. OP ⊥ PQ
From the above figure, it is also seen that △OPQ is a right-angled triangle.
It is given that
OQ = 25 cm and PQ = 24 cm
By using Pythagorean theorem in △OPQ,
OQ2 = OP2 + PQ2
=> (25)2 = OP2 + (24)2
=> OP2 = 625 – 576
=> OP2 = 49
=> OP = 7 cm
So, option A i.e. 7 cm is the radius of the given circle.

Q. 2: Prove that the tangents drawn at the ends of a diameter of a circle are parallel.
Solution:
First, draw a circle and connect two points A and B such that AB becomes the diameter of the circle. Now, draw two tangents PQ and RS at points A and B respectively.

Now, both radii i.e. AO and OP are perpendicular to the tangents.
So, OB is perpendicular to RS and OA perpendicular to PQ
So, ∠OAP = ∠OAQ = ∠OBR = ∠OBS = 90°
From the above figure, angles OBR and OAQ are alternate interior angles.
Also, ∠OBR = ∠OAQ and ∠OBS = ∠OAP (Since they are also alternate interior angles)
So, it can be said that line PQ and the line RS will be parallel to each other. (Hence Proved).

Q. 3: A quadrilateral ABCD is drawn to circumscribe a circle as shown in the figure. Prove that AB + CD = AD + BC

Solution:
From this figure,
(i) DR = DS
(ii) BP = BQ
(iii) AP = AS
(iv) CR = CQ
Since they are tangents on the circle from points D, B, A, and C respectively.
Now, adding the LHS and RHS of the above equations we get,
DR + BP + AP+ CR = DS + BQ + AS + CQ
By rearranging them we get,
(DR + CR) + (BP + AP) = (CQ + BQ) + (DS + AS)
By simplifying,
AD + BC = CD + AB

Q. 4: Two concentric circles are of radii 5 cm and 3 cm. Find the length of the chord of the larger circle which touches the smaller circle.
Solution:
Draw two concentric circles with the centre O. Now, draw a chord AB in the larger circle which touches the smaller circle at a point P as shown in the figure below.

From the above diagram, AB is tangent to the smaller circle to point P.
∴ OP ⊥ AB
Using Pythagoras theorem in triangle OPA,
OA2 = AP2 + OP2
=> 52 = AP2 + 32
=> AP2 = 25 – 9 = 16
=> AP = 4
OP ⊥ AB
Since the perpendicular from the centre of the circle bisects the chord, AP will be equal to PB
So, AB = 2AP = 2 × 4 = 8 cm
Hence, the length of the chord of the larger circle is 8 cm.

Q. 5: Let s denote the semi-perimeter of a triangle ABC in which BC = a, CA = b, AB = c. If a circle touches the sides BC, CA, AB at D, E, F, respectively, prove that BD = s – b.
Solution:

According to the question,
A triangle ABC with BC = a , CA = b and AB = c . Also, a circle is inscribed which touches the sides BC, CA and AB at D, E and F respectively and s is semi- perimeter of the triangle
To Prove: BD = s – b
Proof:
According to the question,
We have,
Semi Perimeter = s
Perimeter = 2s

2s = AB + BC + AC [1]
As we know,
Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal
So we have
AF = AE [2] [Tangents from point A]
BF = BD [3] [Tangents From point B]
CD = CE [4] [Tangents From point C]
Adding [2] [3] and [4],
AF + BF + CD = AE + BD + CE
AB + CD = AC + BD
Adding BD both side,
AB + CD + BD = AC + BD + BD
AB + BC – AC = 2BD
AB + BC + AC – AC – AC = 2BD
2s – 2AC = 2BD [From 1]
2BD = 2s – 2b [as AC = b]
BD = s – b
Hence proved.
