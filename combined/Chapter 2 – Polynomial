1. Find the value of “p” from the polynomial x2 + 3x + p, if one of the zeroes of the polynomial is 2.
Solution:
As 2 is the zero of the polynomial,
x2 + 3x + p, for x = 2
Now, put x = 2

22 + 3(2) + p = 0
=> 4 + 6 + p = 0
Or, p = -10

2. Does the polynomial a4 + 4a2 + 5 = 0 have real zeroes?
Solution:
In the aforementioned equation, let a2 = x.
Now, the equation becomes,
x2 + 4x2 + 5 = 0
Here, b2 – 4ac will be = 42 – 4(1)(5) = 16 – 20 = -4
So, D = b2 – 4ac < 0
As the discriminant (D) is negative, the given polynomial does not have real roots or zeroes.

3. Compute the zeroes of the polynomial 4x2 – 4x – 8 = 0. Also, establish a relationship between the zeroes and coefficients.
Solution:
Factorise the equation 4x2 – 4x – 8 = 0

4x2 – 4x – 8 = 0

4x2 – 2x – 2x + 1 = 0

2x(2x – 1) – 1(2x -1) = 0
(2x – 1) (2x – 1) = 0
So, the roots of 4x2 – 4x – 8 are (½ and ½)
Relation between the sum of zeroes and coefficients:
½ + ½ = 1 = -4/-4 i.e. (- coefficient of x/ coefficient of x2)
Relation between the product of zeroes and coefficients:
½ × ½ = ¼ i.e (constant/coefficient of x2)

4. Find the quadratic polynomial if its zeroes are 0, √5.
Solution:
A quadratic polynomial can be written using the sum and product of its zeroes as:
x2 +(α + β)x + αβ = 0
Where α and β are the roots of the polynomial equation.
Here, α = 0 and β = √5
So, the equation will be:
x2 +(0 + √5)x + 0(√5) = 0
Or, x2 + √5x = 0

5. Find the value of “x” in the equation 2a2 + 2xa + 5x + 10 if (a + x) is one of its factors.
Solution:
Say, f(a) = 2a2 + 2xa + 5x + 10
Since, (a + x) is a factor of 2a2 + 2xa + 5x + 10, f(-x) = 0
So, f(-x) = 2x2 – 2x2 – 5x + 10 = 0
Or, -5x + 10 = 0
Thus, x = 2

6. How many zeros does the polynomial (x – 3)2 – 4 can have? Also, find its zeroes.
Solution:
Given equation is (x – 3)2 – 4
Now, expand this equation.
=> x2 + 9 – 6x – 4
= x2 – 6x + 5
As the equation has a degree of 2, the number of zeroes it will have is 2.
Now, solve x2 – 6x + 5 = 0 to get the roots.
So, x2 – x – 5x + 5 = 0
=> x(x-1) -5(x-1) = 0
=> (x-1)(x-5)
So, the roots are 1 and 5.

7. α and β are zeroes of the quadratic polynomial x2 – 6x + y. Find the value of ‘y’ if 3α + 2β = 20.
Solution:
Let, f(x) = x² – 6 x + a
From the question,

3α + 2β = 20
From f(x),
α + β = 6———————(ii)
And,
αβ = y———————(iii)
Multiply equation (ii) by 2. Then, subtract the whole equation from equation (i),
=> α = 20 – 12 = 8
Now, substitute this value in equation (ii),
=> β = 6-8 = -2
put the value of α and β in equation (iii) to get the value of y, such as;
y = αβ = -16

8.  If the zeroes of the polynomial x3 – 3x2 + x + 1 are a – b, a, a + b, then find the value of a and b.
Solution:
p(x) = x3 – 3x2 + x + 1
Here, zeroes are given are a – b, a, and a + b
Now, compare the given polynomial equation with general expression.
px3 + qx2 + rx + s = x3 – 3x2 + x + 1
Here, p = 1, q = -3, r = 1 and s = 1
For sum of zeroes:
Sum of zeroes will be = a – b + a + a + b
-q/p = 3a
Substitute the values q and p.
-(-3)/1 = 3a
Or, a = 1
So, the zeroes are 1-b, 1, 1+b.
For product of zeroes:
Product of zeroes = 1(1-b)(1+b)
-s/p=1-𝑏2
=> -1/1=1-𝑏2
Or, 𝑏2 = 1 + 1 =2
So, b = √2
Thus, 1-√2, 1, 1+√2 are the zeroes of equation 𝑥3 − 3𝑥2 + 𝑥 + 1.

9. Find a quadratic polynomial each with the given numbers as the sum and product of its zeroes respectively.
(i) 1/4, -1
(ii) 1,1
(iii) 4, 1
Solution:
(i) From the formulas of sum and product of zeroes, we know,
Sum of zeroes = α + β
Product of zeroes = α β
Given,
Sum of zeroes = 1/4
Product of zeroes = -1
Therefore, if α and β are zeroes of any quadratic polynomial, then the equation can be written as:-
x2 – (α+β)x +αβ = 0
x2 – (1/4)x +(-1) = 0

4x2 – x – 4 = 0
Thus, 4x2 – x – 4 is the quadratic polynomial.
(ii) Given,
Sum of zeroes = 1 = α+β
Product of zeroes = 1 = αβ
Therefore, if α and β are zeroes of any quadratic polynomial, then the equation can be written as:-
x2 – (α+β)x +αβ = 0
x2 – x + 1 = 0
Thus, x2 – x + 1 is the quadratic polynomial.
(iii) Given,
Sum of zeroes, α + β = 4
Product of zeroes, α β = 1
Therefore, if α and β are zeroes of any quadratic polynomial, then the equation can be written as:-
x2 – (α+β)x +αβ = 0
x2 – 4x +1 = 0
Thus, x2 – 4x +1 is the quadratic polynomial.

10. Obtain all other zeroes of 3x4+6x3-2x2-10x-5, if two of its zeroes are √(5/3) and-√(5/3).
Solutions: Since this is a polynomial equation of degree 4, hence there will be total 4 roots.
√(5/3) and-√(5/3) are zeroes of polynomial f(x).
∴ [x-√(5/3)] [x+√(5/3)] = x2-(5/3) = 0
(3x2−5)=0, is a factor of given polynomial f(x).
Now, if we divide f(x) by (3x2−5) the quotient thus obtained will also be a factor of f(x) and the remainder will be 0.

Therefore, 3x4+6x3-2x2-10x-5 = (3x2 – 5) (x2 + 2x +1)
Now, on further factorizing (x2 + 2x +1) we get,
x2 + 2x +1 = x2 + x + x +1 = 0
x(x + 1) + 1(x+1) = 0
(x+1) (x+1) = 0
So, its zeroes are given by: x= −1 and x = −1.
Therefore, all four zeroes of given polynomial equation are:
√(5/3) and-√(5/3), −1 and −1.
Hence, is the answer.
