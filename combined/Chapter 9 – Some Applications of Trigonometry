Q.1:  The shadow of a tower standing on level ground is found to be 40 m longer when the Sun’s altitude is 30° than when it is 60°. Find the height of the tower.
Solution:
Let AB be the tower and BC be the length of its shadow when sun’s altitude (angle of elevation from the top of the tower to the tip of the shadow) is 60° and DB be the length of the shadow when the angle of elevation is 30°.

Let us assume, AB = h m, BC = x m
DB = (40 +x) m
In right triangle ABC,
tan 60° = AB/BC
√3 = h/x
h = √3 x……….(i)
In right triangle ABD,
tan 30° = AB/BD

1/√3 =h/(x + 40) ……..(ii)
From (i) and (ii),
x(√3 )(√3 ) = x + 40

3x = x + 40

2x = 40
x = 20
Substituting x = 20 in (i),
h = 20√3
Hence, the height of the tower is 20√3 m.

Q. 2: A tree breaks due to storm and the broken part bends so that the top of the tree touches the ground making an angle 30° with it. The distance between the foot of the tree to the point where the top touches the ground is 8 m. Find the height of the tree.
Solution:
Using given instructions, draw a figure. Let AC be the broken part of the tree. Angel C = 30 degrees.
BC = 8 m
To Find: Height of the tree, which is AB

From figure: Total height of the tree is the sum of AB and AC i.e. AB+AC
In right ΔABC,
Using Cosine and tangent angles,
cos 30° = BC/AC
We know that, cos 30° = √3/2
√3/2 = 8/AC
AC = 16/√3 …(1)
Also,
tan 30° = AB/BC

1/√3 = AB/8
AB = 8/√3 ….(2)
From (1) and (2),
Total height of the tree = AB + AC = 16/√3 + 8/√3 = 24/√3 = 8√3 m.

Q. 3: Two poles of equal heights are standing opposite each other on either side of the road, which is 80 m wide. From a point between them on the road, the angles of elevation of the top of the poles are 60° and 30°, respectively. Find the height of the poles and the distances of the point from the poles.
Solution:
Let AB and CD be the poles of equal height.
O is the point between them from where the height of elevation taken. BD is the distance between the poles.

As per the above figure, AB = CD,
OB + OD = 80 m
Now,
In right ΔCDO,
tan 30° = CD/OD

1/√3 = CD/OD
CD = OD/√3 … (1)
In right ΔABO,
tan 60° = AB/OB
√3 = AB/(80-OD)
AB = √3(80-OD)
AB = CD (Given)
√3(80-OD) = OD/√3 (Using equation (1))

3(80-OD) = OD

240 – 3 OD = OD

4 OD = 240
OD = 60
Substituting the value of OD in equation (1)
CD = OD/√3
CD = 60/√3
CD = 20√3 m
Also,
OB + OD = 80 m
⇒ OB = (80-60) m = 20 m
Therefore, the height of the poles are 20√3 m and distance from the point of elevation are 20 m and 60 m respectively.

Q. 4: A pole 6 m high casts a shadow 2√ 3 m long on the ground, then the Sun’s elevation is
(A) 60° (B) 45° (C) 30° (D) 90°
Solution:
Let BC be the pole and AB be its shadow.

In triangle ABC,
tan θ = BC/AB
= 6/2√ 3
= 3/√ 3
= (√ 3 × √ 3 )/ √ 3
= √ 3
tan θ = tan 60°
θ = 60°
Hence, the Sun’s elevation is 60°.

Q. 5: The angle of elevation of the top of a tower from two points distant s and t from its foot are complementary. Prove that the height of the tower is √st.
Solution:
Let BC = s; PC = t
Let the height of the tower be AB = h.
∠ABC = θ and ∠APC = 90° – θ
(∵ the angle of elevation of the top of the tower from two points P and B are complementary)

In triangle ABC,
tan θ = AC/BC = h/s ………..(i)
In triangle APC,
tan (90° – θ) = AC/PC = h/t
cot θ = h/t ………..(ii)
Multiplying (i) and (ii),
tan θ × cot θ = (h/s) × (h/t)

1 = h2/st
h2 = st
h = √st
Hence, the height of the tower is √st.
