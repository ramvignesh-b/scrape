Q. 1: In the given figure, PS/SQ = PT/TR and ∠ PST = ∠ PRQ. Prove that PQR is an isosceles triangle.

Solution:
Given,
PS/SQ = PT/TR
We know that if a line divides any two sides of a triangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel to the third side.
Therefore, ST // QR
And ∠ PST = ∠ PQR (Corresponding angles) ……..(i)
∠ PST = ∠ PRQ (given( ………(ii)
From (i) and (ii),
∠ PRQ = ∠ PQR
Therefore, PQ = PR (sides opposite the equal angles)
Hence, PQR is an isosceles triangle.

Q. 2: In the figure, DE // AC and DF // AE. Prove that BF/FE = BE/EC.

Solution:
Given that,
In triangle ABC, DE // AC.
By Basic Proportionality Theorem,
BD/DA = BE/EC……….(i)
Also, given that DF // AE.
Again by Basic Proportionality Theorem,
BD/DA = BF/FE……….(ii)
From (i) and (ii),
BE/EC = BF/FE
Hence proved.

Q. 3: In the given figure, altitudes AD and CE of ∆ ABC intersect each other at the point P. Show that:
(i) ∆AEP ~ ∆ CDP
(ii) ∆ABD ~ ∆ CBE
(iii) ∆AEP ~ ∆ADB
(iv) ∆ PDC ~ ∆ BEC

Solution:
Given that AD and CE are the altitudes of triangle ABC and these altitudes intersect each other at P.
(i) In ΔAEP and ΔCDP,
∠AEP = ∠CDP (90° each)
∠APE = ∠CPD (Vertically opposite angles)
Hence, by AA similarity criterion,
ΔAEP ~ ΔCDP
(ii) In ΔABD and ΔCBE,
∠ADB = ∠CEB ( 90° each)
∠ABD = ∠CBE (Common Angles)
Hence, by AA similarity criterion,
ΔABD ~ ΔCBE
(iii) In ΔAEP and ΔADB,
∠AEP = ∠ADB (90° each)
∠PAE = ∠DAB (Common Angles)
Hence, by AA similarity criterion,
ΔAEP ~ ΔADB
(iv) In ΔPDC and ΔBEC,
∠PDC = ∠BEC (90° each)
∠PCD = ∠BCE (Common angles)
Hence, by AA similarity criterion,
ΔPDC ~ ΔBEC

Q. 4: A vertical pole of length 6 m casts a shadow 4 m long on the ground and at the same time a tower casts a shadow 28 m long. Find the height of the tower
Solution:
Given,
Length of the vertical pole = 6 m
Shadow of the pole = 4 m
Let the height of the tower be h m.
Length of the shadow of the tower = 28 m

In ΔABC and ΔDFE,
∠C = ∠E (angle of elevation)
∠B = ∠F = 90°
By AA similarity criterion,
ΔABC ~ ΔDFE
We know that the corresponding sides of two similar triangles are proportional.
AB/DF = BC/EF

6/h = 4/28
h = (6 ×28)/4
h = 6 × 7
h = 72
Hence, the height of the tower = 42 m.

Q. 5: If ΔABC ~ ΔQRP, ar (ΔABC) / ar (ΔPQR) =9/4 , AB = 18 cm and BC = 15 cm, then PR is equal to 
(A) 10 cm (B) 12 cm (C) 20/3 cm (D) 8 cm
Solution:
Given that ΔABC ~ ΔQRP.
ar (ΔABC) / ar (ΔPQR) =9/4
AB = 18 cm and BC = 15 cm
We know that the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.
ar (ΔABC) / ar (ΔPQR) = BC2/RP2

9/4 = (15)2/RP2
RP2 = (4/9) ×225
PR2 = 100
Therefore, PR = 10 cm

Q. 6: If the areas of two similar triangles are equal, prove that they are congruent.
Solution:
Let ΔABC and ΔPQR be the two similar triangles with equal area.

To prove ΔABC ≅ ΔPQR.
Proof:
ΔABC ~ ΔPQR
∴ Area of (ΔABC)/Area of (ΔPQR) = BC2/QR2
⇒ BC2/QR2 =1 [Since, ar (ΔABC) = ar (ΔPQR)]
⇒ BC2/QR2
⇒ BC = QR
Similarly, we can prove that
AB = PQ and AC = PR
Therefore, ΔABC ≅ ΔPQR [SSS criterion of congruence]
Q. 7: O is any point inside a rectangle ABCD as shown in the figure. Prove that OB2 + OD2 = OA2 + OC2.

Solution:
Through O, draw PQ || BC so that P lies on AB and Q lies on DC.

PQ || BC
Therefore, PQ ⊥ AB and PQ ⊥ DC (∠ B = 90° and ∠ C = 90°)
So, ∠ BPQ = 90° and ∠ CQP = 90°
Hence, BPQC and APQD are both rectangles.
By Pythagoras theorem,
In ∆ OPB,
OB2 = BP2 + OP2…..(1)
Similarly,
In ∆ OQD,
OD2 = OQ2 + DQ2…..(2)
In ∆ OQC,
OC2 = OQ2 + CQ2…..(3)
In ∆ OAP,
OA2 = AP2 + OP2…..(4)
Adding (1) and (2),
OB2+ OD2 = BP2 + OP2 + OQ2 + DQ2
= CQ2 + OP2 + OQ2 + AP2
(since BP = CQ and DQ = AP)
= CQ2 + OQ2 + OP2 + AP2
= OC2 + OA2 [From (3) and (4)]
Hence proved that OB2 + OD2 = OA2 + OC2.

Solution:
(i) Given, sides of the triangle are 7 cm, 24 cm, and 25 cm.
Squaring the lengths of the sides of the, we will get 49, 576, and 625.
49 + 576 = 625
(7)2 + (24)2 = (25)2
Therefore, the above equation satisfies Pythagoras theorem. Hence, it is a right-angled triangle.
Length of Hypotenuse = 25 cm
(ii) Given, sides of the triangle are 3 cm, 8 cm, and 6 cm.
Squaring the lengths of these sides, we will get 9, 64, and 36.
Clearly, 9 + 36 ≠ 64
Or, 32 + 62 ≠ 82
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the lengths of two sides is not equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse.
Hence, the given triangle does not satisfy Pythagoras theorem.

(since BP = CQ and DQ = AP)
= CQ2 + OQ2 + OP2 + AP2
= OC2 + OA2 [From (3) and (4)]
Hence proved that OB2 + OD2 = OA2 + OC2.
