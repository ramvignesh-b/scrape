Q.1: Draw a line segment of length 7 cm. Find a point P on it which divides it in the ratio 3:5.
Solution:
Steps of construction:
1. Draw a line segment, AB = 7 cm.
2. Draw a ray, AX, making an acute angle downward with AB.
3. Mark the points A1, A2, A3 … A8 on AX.
4. Mark the points such that AA1 = A1A2 = A2A3 = ….., A7A8.
5. Join BA8.
6. Draw a line parallel to BA8 through the point A3, to meet AB on P.
Hence AP: PB = 3: 5


Q.2: Construct a triangle with sides 5 cm, 6 cm and 7 cm and then another triangle whose sides are 7/5 of the corresponding sides of the first triangle.
Solution:
Steps of Constructions:

Therefore, ΔAB’C’ is the required triangle.
 

Q.3: Draw a circle of radius 3 cm. Take two points P and Q on one of its extended diameter each at a distance of 7 cm from its centre. Draw tangents to the circle from these two points P and Q.
Solution:
Steps of construction:


Q. 4: Draw a circle with the help of a bangle. Take a point outside the circle. Construct the pair of tangents from this point to the circle.
Solution:
Steps of construction:


Q. 5: Draw two concentric circles of radii 3 cm and 5 cm. Taking a point on the outer circle construct the pair of tangents to the other. Measure the length of a tangent and verify it by actual calculation.
Solution:
Steps of construction:

Hence AP and BP are the required tangents.
