Q.1. Find the mean of the 32 numbers, such that if the mean of 10 of them is 15 and the mean of 20 of them is 11. The last two numbers are 10.
Solution: The given mean of 10 numbers = 15
So, Mean = sum of observations/ no. of observations

15 = sum of observations / 10
Sum of observations of 10 numbers = 150
Similarly, Mean = sum of observations/ no. of observations

11 = sum of observations / 20
Sum of observations of 20 numbers = 220
Hence, Mean = sum of observations/ no. of observations
Mean of 32 numbers = (150 +220 + 20 ) / 32 = 390 /32

Q.2. Find the mean of the first 10 natural numbers.
Solution: The first 10 natural numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Mean = (1 +2 +3 +4 +5+ 6+ 7+ 8+ 9+10) / 10 = 55/10 =5.5

Q.3. Find the value of y from the following observations if these are already arranged in ascending order. The Median is 63.

20, 24, 42, y , y +2, 73, 75, 80, 99
Solution:
As the number of observations made are odd, so the median will be the mean of 5th and 6th term.
y + 2 = 63
y = 63 -2 = 61

Q.4 While checking the value of 20 observations, it was noted that 125 was wrongly noted as 25 while calculating the mean and then the mean was 60. Find the correct mean.
Solution:
Let y be the sum of observation of 19 (20 – 1) numbers leaving 125,
So, y + 25 = 20 × 60 = 1200 (Mean = sum of observations/ no. of observations)
As we know
x+25=20×60=1200
Also
x+125=20×y=20y
Next, Subtract 125−25=20y−1200

20y=1300
y=65

Q.5. Find the mode of the following items.

0, 5, 5, 1, 6, 4, 3, 0, 2, 5, 5, 6
Solution: On arranging the items in ascending order, we get:

0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6
As we can see 5 occurs maximum number of times.
So, the mode is = 6

Q.6. A student scored the following marks in 6 subjects:

30, 19, 25, 30, 27, 30
Find his modal score.
Solution: If we arrange his marks in ascending order

19, 25, 27, 30, 30, 30
As we can see, 30 occurs maximum number of times. So, The mode is 30.

Q.7.The daily minimum steps climbed by a man during a week were as under:
Find the mean steps
Solution: Number of steps climbed in a week : 35, 30, 27, 32, 23, 28.
So, we get,
Mean = sum of observation (steps) / total no of observations
= (35+30+27+32+23+28) / 7
= 175/7 = 25

Q. 8 : If the mean of 4 numbers, 2,6,7 and a is 15 and also the mean of other 5 numbers, 6, 18 , 1, a, b is 50. What is the value of b?
Solution:
Mean = sum of observations / no. of observations

15 = (2 + 6 + 7 +a)/4

15 = (15 + a) / 4

15 * 4 = 15 + a

60 – 15 = a
a = 45
Similarly, Mean = sum of observations / no. of observations

50 = (18 + 6 + 1 +a + b)/5

50 = (18 + 6 + 1 +45 + b)/5

50 = (70 + b)/5

250 = 70 + b
b = 250 – 70 = 180
So, The value of b = 180.

Q.9: The mean of the frequency distribution are 28 and 16 respectively. Find the median.
Solution:

3 x median = (mode + 2 mean)

3 x 26 = (29 +2 mean)

78 – 29 = 2 mean

2mean = 49
Mean = 49/2 = 24.5

Question 10. The cumulative frequency table is useful in determining the ____________?
Solution: Median

Q. 1: Consider the following distribution of daily wages of 50 workers of a factory.
Find the mean daily wages of the workers of the factory by using an appropriate method.
Solution:
Find the midpoint of the given interval using the formula.
Midpoint (xi) = (upper limit + lower limit)/2
In this case, the value of mid-point (xi) is very large, so let us assume the mean value, A = 150 and class interval is h = 20.
So, ui = (xi – A)/h = ui = (xi – 150)/20
Substitute and find the values as follows:
So, the formula to find out the mean is:
Mean = x̄ = A + h∑fiui /∑fi =150 + (20 × -12/50) = 150 – 4.8 = 145.20
Therefore, mean daily wage of the workers = Rs. 145.20

Q.2: Thirty women were examined in a hospital by a doctor and the number of heartbeats per minute were recorded and summarised as follows. Find the mean heartbeats per minute for these women, choosing a suitable method.
Solution:
From the given data, let us assume the mean as A = 75.5
xi = (Upper limit + Lower limit)/2
Class size (h) = 3
Now, find the ui and fi ui as follows:
 
Mean = x̄ = A + h∑fiui /∑fi
= 75.5 + 3×(4/30)

75.5 + 4/10
= 75.5 + 0.4
= 75.9
Therefore, the mean heart beats per minute for these women is 75.9

Q. 3: The median of an ungrouped data and the median calculated when the same data is grouped are always the same. Do you think that this is a correct statement? Give reason.
Solution: 
In order to calculate the median of a grouped data, the formula used is based on the assumption that the observations in the classes are uniformly distributed or equally spaced. Hence, we cannot say that the statement “the median of an ungrouped data and the median calculated when the same data is grouped are always the same” is always correct.

Q. 4: The following data gives the distribution of total monthly household expenditure of 200 families of a village. Find the modal monthly expenditure of the families. Also, find the mean monthly expenditure :
Solution:
From the given data:
Modal class = 1500-2000
l = 1500
Frequencies:
fm = 40
f1 = 24, f< = 33 and
h = 500
Mode formula:
Substitute the values in the formula, we get
Mode = 1500 + ((16 x 500)/23)
Mode = 1500+(8000/23) = 1500 + 347.83
Therefore, the modal monthly expenditure of the families= Rupees 1847.83
Calculation for mean:
First find the midpoint using the formula, xi =(upper limit +lower limit)/2
Let us assume a mean, A be 2750
The formula to calculate the mean,
Mean = x̄ = a + (∑fiui /∑fi) х h
Substitute the values in the given formula
= 2750 + (-35/200) х 500
= 2750 – 87.50
= 2662.50
So, the mean monthly expenditure of the families = Rupees 2662.50

Q. 5: A student noted the number of cars passing through a spot on a road for 100
periods each of 3 minutes and summarised it in the table given below. Find the mode
of the data:
Solution:
From the given data:
Modal class = 40 – 50, l = 40,
class width (h) = 10, fm = 20, f1 = 12 and f2 = 11
Substitute the values
Mode = 40 + (80/17) = 40 + 4.7 = 44.7
Thus, the mode of the given data is 44.7 cars

Q. 6: An aircraft has 120 passenger seats. The number of seats occupied during 100
flights are given in the following table :
Determine the mean number of seats occupied over the flights.
Solution: 
∴ Assumed mean, a = 110
Class width, h = 4
And total observations, N = 100
= 110 + (-8/100)
= 110 – 0.08
= 109.92
But we know that the seats cannot be in decimal.
Therefore, the number of seats = 109 (approx).

Q. 7: A survey regarding the heights (in cm) of 51 girls of Class X of a school was conducted and the following data were obtained:
Find the median height.
Solution: 
To calculate the median height, we need to find the class intervals and their corresponding frequencies.
The given distribution being of the less than type, 140, 145, 150,… ., 165 give the upper limits of the corresponding class intervals.
So, the classes should be below 140, 140 – 145, 145 – 150,… ., 160 – 165.
Observe that from the given distribution, we find that there are 4 girls with height less than 140, i.e., the frequency of class interval below 140 is 4.
Now, there are 11 girls with heights less than 145 and 4 girls with height less than 140. Therefore, the number of girls with height in the interval of 140 – 145 is 11 – 4 = 7.
Similarly, the frequency of 145 – 150 is 29 – 11 = 18, for 150 – 155, it is 40 – 29 = 11, and so on. So, our frequency distribution table with the given cumulative frequencies becomes:
Now n = 51. So, n/2 = 51/2 =25.5
This observation lies in class 145 – 150.
Then, l (the lower limit) = 145,
cf (the cumulative frequency of the class preceding 145 – 150) = 11,
f (the frequency of the median class 145 – 150) = 18,
h (the class size) = 5.
Using the formula,
Median \(=l+(\frac{\frac{n}{2}-cf}{f})\times h\)
we have Median \(=145+(\frac{25.5-11}{18})\times 5\)
= 145 + 72.5/18 = 149.03.
So, the median height of the girls is 149.03 cm.
This means that the height of about 50% of the girls is less than this height, and 50% are taller than this height.
Q. 8: The lengths of 40 leaves of a plant are measured correct to the nearest millimetre, and the data obtained is represented in the following table :



Length(in mm)

Find the median length of leaves.  
(Hint: The data needs to be converted to continuous classes for finding the median since the formula assumes continuous classes. The classes then change to 117.5 – 126.5, 126.5 – 135.5, . . ., 171.5 – 180.5.)
Solution:
Since the data are not continuous reduce 0.5 in the lower limit and add 0.5 in the upper limit.

From the above tab
n = 40 and n/2 = 20
Median class = 144.5-153.5
then, l = 144.5,
cf = 17, f = 12 & h = 9
Median \(=l+(\frac{\frac{n}{2}-cf}{f})\times h\)
Median \(=144.5+(\frac{250-17}{12})\times 9\)
=144.5+(9/4)
=146.75 mm
Therefore, the median length of the leaves = 146.75 mm.

60



Solution:
From the given data,
n = 60
Median of the given data = 28.5
Where, n/2 = 30
Median class is 20 – 30 with a cumulative frequency = 25 + x
Lower limit of median class = 20,
Cf = 5 + x ,
f = 20 & h = 10
Median = \(=l+(\frac{\frac{n}{2}-cf}{f})\times h\)
Substitute the values
28.5=20+10(30−5−x)/20)
8.5 =(25-x)/2
17 = 25-x
Therefore, x =8
Now, from cumulative frequency, we can identify the value of x + y as follows:
Since,
60=5+20+15+5+x+y
Now, substitute the value of x, to find y
60 = 5+20+15+5+8+y
y = 60-53
y = 7
Therefore, the value of x = 8 and y = 7

(35, 27), (40, 30) on the same axes as in the above figure. to get the ‘less than’ ogive, as
shown below.

The abscissa of their point of intersection is nearly 17.5, which is the median. This can also be verified by using the formula.
Hence, the median profit (in lakhs) is Rs. 17.5.

Median \(=l+(\frac{\frac{n}{2}-cf}{f})\times h\)
Median \(=144.5+(\frac{250-17}{12})\times 9\)

Median class is 20 – 30 with a cumulative frequency = 25 + x
Lower limit of median class = 20,
Cf = 5 + x ,
f = 20 & h = 10
Median = \(=l+(\frac{\frac{n}{2}-cf}{f})\times h\)
Substitute the values
28.5=20+10(30−5−x)/20)
8.5 =(25-x)/2
17 = 25-x
Therefore, x =8
Now, from cumulative frequency, we can identify the value of x + y as follows:
Since,
60=5+20+15+5+x+y
Now, substitute the value of x, to find y
60 = 5+20+15+5+8+y
y = 60-53
y = 7
Therefore, the value of x = 8 and y = 7

(1) The difference of the upper limit of the median class and the lower limit of the modal class is
(A) 0 (B) 19 (C) 20 (D) 38
(2) In the formula x = a + h(fiui/fi), for finding the mean of grouped frequency distribution, ui =

(B) h (xi – a)
(C) (xi –a)/h
(D) (a – xi)/h



= 145 + 72.5/18 = 149.03.
So, the median height of the girls is 149.03 cm.
This means that the height of about 50% of the girls is less than this height, and 50% are taller than this height.

Q. 8: The lengths of 40 leaves of a plant are measured correct to the nearest millimetre, and the data obtained is represented in the following table :
Find the median length of leaves.  
(Hint: The data needs to be converted to continuous classes for finding the median since the formula assumes continuous classes. The classes then change to 117.5 – 126.5, 126.5 – 135.5, . . ., 171.5 – 180.5.)
Solution:
Since the data are not continuous reduce 0.5 in the lower limit and add 0.5 in the upper limit.
From the above tab
n = 40 and n/2 = 20
Median class = 144.5-153.5
then, l = 144.5,
cf = 17, f = 12 & h = 9
Median \(=l+(\frac{\frac{n}{2}-cf}{f})\times h\)
Median \(=144.5+(\frac{250-17}{12})\times 9\)
=144.5+(9/4)
=146.75 mm
Therefore, the median length of the leaves = 146.75 mm.
Q. 9: If the median of a distribution given below is 28.5 then, find the value of an x &y.

Solution:
From the given data,
n = 60
Median of the given data = 28.5
Where, n/2 = 30
Median class is 20 – 30 with a cumulative frequency = 25 + x
Lower limit of median class = 20,
Cf = 5 + x ,
f = 20 & h = 10
Median = \(=l+(\frac{\frac{n}{2}-cf}{f})\times h\)
Substitute the values
28.5=20+10(30−5−x)/20)
8.5 =(25-x)/2
17 = 25-x
Therefore, x =8
Now, from cumulative frequency, we can identify the value of x + y as follows:
Since,
60=5+20+15+5+x+y
Now, substitute the value of x, to find y
60 = 5+20+15+5+8+y
y = 60-53
y = 7
Therefore, the value of x = 8 and y = 7

(35, 27), (40, 30) on the same axes as in the above figure. to get the ‘less than’ ogive, as
shown below.

The abscissa of their point of intersection is nearly 17.5, which is the median. This can also be verified by using the formula.
Hence, the median profit (in lakhs) is Rs. 17.5.
